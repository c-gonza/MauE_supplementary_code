# MauE_supplementary_code
This is a repository for the code used in dataset construction for the scientific publication center in MauE as a disulfide bond formation protein.

All code used is in this github. 
supplementary data files can be gound at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18197764

the notebooks listed are sequential and are set up so they can be repeated by others to reproduce the data analysis.

This data was constructed before in 10.2024 and there has since been updates to Uniprot and Interpro that will change output if starting from 
raw API pulls. To recreate our exact materials use the initial data tables in the directory "uncombined_rawdata" as a starting point for notebook
1, and continue from there.
