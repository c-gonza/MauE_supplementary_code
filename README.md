# MauE_supplementary_code
This is a repository for the code used in dataset construction for the scientific publication "MauE reveals a new pathway for disulfide bond formation in bacteria". For any additional information please reach out through github or by the correspondence email listed in the publication.

This code was based on the InterPro API suggested code, as well as the NCBI API guides. The intention is for this to be run as a .ipynb but a python file is also provided. Included are the run files for GNINA which was used for molecular docking predictions, and their output scores. 

The GNINA version used was 1.3 and can be found here: https://github.com/gnina/gnina.git

Information for the plasmid backbone used in all molecular biology is under plasmid_inf. This includes the plasmid map, the annotated .dna file and the unannotated .fasta file.
